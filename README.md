## Installation

To install this application on your local machine, you will first need to clone down this repository using the git clone command in your terminal. After cloning the repo, navigate to where you stored the project and run an npm install to install the dependencies needed to use the app. Once the dependencies are installed, create a .env file in both your client and server folders. The client side folder will need a VITE_CLOUDINARY_URL, a VITE_CLOUDINARY_NAME, and a VITE_CLOUDINARY_PRESET. The .env in the server will need a JWT_SECRET and a MONGO_URI. When you have the .env files set up, do an npm run build, followed by an npm run develop. Running these scripts will start the backend server and the frontend application. If you do not want to get the application running locally, we have a live deployed site where you can create your next masterpiece!

## Usage

Users can create an account using their email and a unique username, then sign into their new account in order to use the application to its fullest extint. Feel free to navigate the home page where you will see many other users creations, click the profile button to visit a users page, leave likes and share your thoughts on their work with comments! Want to create a work of your own imagination? Visit the canvas page where you have an abundance of tools to draw a picture, or multiple pictures to make an animation of whatever you want! Once you are done with your new work of art, view it on your own profile page to see if anyone has left a like or comment on it yet!

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, Socket.io

## Code Snippets

### Socket.io Implementation

This code snippet is showing the server listening for emits from the resolvers for creating new Loops, adding comments, and leaving likes. When the resolvers are used, they send information to both the frontend and the backend to let them know that a new update needs to happen so that users are able to see their new data immediatley without having to refresh the page.

```javascript
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log(`User connected: ${socket.id}`);

  // Listen for 'newLoop' event
  socket.on("newLoop", (newLoop) => {
    console.log("New loop received on server:", newLoop);
    io.emit("newLoop", newLoop); // Broadcast to all clients
  });

  // Listen to new Comments in the resolvers
  socket.on("newComment", (newComment) => {
    console.log("New Comment received on server:", newComment);
    io.emit("newComment", newComment);
  });

  // Listen to new Likes in the resolvers
  socket.on("newLike", (newLike) => {
    console.log("New Like received on server:", newLike);
    io.emit("newLike", newLike);
  });

  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    console.log(`User disconnected: ${socket.id}`);
  });
});
```

### Loop Save Handler

This code snippet is showing how we are sending out frame information and the canvas images to Cloudinary (the 3rd party database where we are storing our frames) and also saving the URLs of each of the frames. This allows us to keep track of all of our frames without having to store them in our local database, because they take up a lot of space. We can then call on the URLs in the frontend of our application, and Cloudinary automatically formats and displays our frames.

```typescript
const handleLoopSave = async (e: SubmitEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const userConfirm = confirm("Are you sure you want to save?");
    if (!userConfirm) {
        return;
    }

    try {
        await saveCurrentFrameData();
        const updatedFrames = await Promise.all(
            frames.map(async (frame) => {
                if (!frame.canvasImg || !(frame.canvasImg instanceof Blob)) {
                    console.log('Skipping upload for frame:', frame);
                    return {
                        frameId: frame.id,
                        canvasImg: frame.canvasImg, // Save Cloudinary URL
                    };
                }

                // Upload Blob to Cloudinary
                const cloudinaryUrl = await uploadToCloudinary(frame.canvasImg);
                console.log('Cloudinary URL for frame:', frame.id, cloudinaryUrl);

                return {
                    frameId: frame.id,
                    canvasImg: cloudinaryUrl, // Replace Blob with Cloudinary URL
                };
            })
        );
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error saving loop:", error);
    }
};
```
